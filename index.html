                <p>I'm a first year computer science major at Cal Poly SLO! I've been coding since my sophomore year of high school.
                I am so excited to be involved with many different clubs and organizations on campus, including Hack4Impact.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of school, I have a lot of hobbies. I'm actually a dancer! I started ballet when I was five and have loved it since.
                I dabble in other dance styles, but always find myself the most comfortable with the classical dance form. 
                I also did soccer for 10 years growing up. I loved it, but couldn't find the time for it after my sophomore year of high school.
                Every now and then, I'll kick the ball around with my friends or my dad, who was my coach for several of the years that I played.
