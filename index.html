                <p>Hi! My name is Ally, and I'm a first-year Computer Science major (concentrating in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) & Undergraduate Research Assistant at California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO). My research is focused on using sentiment analysis to better understand how users engage with social media content, and I’m working on a study that will explore the cognitive and psychological responses to that content. The project is still in the early stages, but I’m excited about the insights we’ll uncover as I continue to develop the study’s methodology.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Outside of my academic research, I’ve been working on a personal project where I’m building a sentiment analysis tool for product reviews on e-commerce platforms like Amazon. This tool will help businesses understand customer sentiment and can be used to guide product decisions based on feedback. It’s been an amazing opportunity to apply what I’ve learned in Python and machine learning to create something that has real-world applications and can actually make a difference for businesses.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I have experience coding in several languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, TypeScript, and Python. I have coded several websites, quizzes, and tools before using various IDEs. I also have experience working with cryptography, cybersecurity, and chatbots. Before coming to Cal Poly, I obtained various coding certificates (see my certification section) though organizations such as Girls Who Code, Coursera, and EDx. I spent the summer after my junior year in high school living and studying at COSMOS, UC Davis. I worked for 6.5 hours every day in labs between two classes I was taking. In one class, we worked with electrical equipment such as breadboards and oscillators. My class went as far as building the Nobel Prize-winning standing tunneling microscope in teams. My other class was heavy in C-programming, and we worked with complex calculations that combined mechanics and representing physics (using Jupyter, Notebook, and Linux) with computer algorithms.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I love getting involved and collaborating with others. I'm open to working on projects beyond my immediate community, and I'd love to connect! If you have any questions, business-related inquiries, or want to work with me, feel free to shoot me a message!
