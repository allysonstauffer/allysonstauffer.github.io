                <div class="about-text">
                <p>I'm a first year computer science major at Cal Poly SLO originally from the East San Francisco Bay Area! I've been coding since my sophomore year of high school.
                I am so excited to be involved with many different clubs and organizations on campus, including Hack4Impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have experience coding in several languages, including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and Python. I have coded several websites, quizzes, and tools before through IDEs
                  such as Replit and VSCode. I am particluarly fond of web development, as I love the intersection between technology and design. I intend to pair my computer science degree
                  with a more creative minor such as graphic communications. I also have experience working with cryptography, cybersecurity, and chatbots. A lot of this experience came from
                  my programs with Girls Who Code, a non-profit organization that teaches women and minorities how to code. I earned seven certificates through GWC and graduated from three of
                  their programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before coming to Cal Poly, I spent the summer after my junior year living and studying at UC Davis. I worked for 6.5 hours every day in labs between two classes I was taking.
                  In one class, we worked with electrical breadboards and oscillators, and we went as far as building the Nobel Prize-winning standing tunneling microscope in teams. My other class
                  was heavy in C-programming, and we worked with complex calculations that combined mechanics and representing physics (using Jupyter, Notebook, and Linux) with computer algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of school, I have a lot of hobbies. I'm actually a dancer! I started ballet when I was five and have loved it since.
                I dabble in other dance styles, but always find myself the most comfortable with the classical dance form. 
                I also did soccer for 10 years growing up. I'll still kick the ball around every now and then with my friends or my dad, who was my coach for several of the years that I played.
