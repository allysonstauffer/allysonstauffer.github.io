            <p class="project-name">Empowering Data: Analyzing Educational Trends for Haitian Women.</p>
            <p class="project-description">In this project, I developed a data analysis tool using Python, Pandas, and Matplot
              library. Focusing on visualize educational trends for Haitian women over time, I created a scatterplot that tracks
               average years of schooling among different age groups over time. I researched and posed a researh question exploring 
               the disparities in educational opportunities for these women in both rural and urban areas.

            <p class="project-name">Minding Change</p>
            <p class="project-description">In 2022, I designed, coded, and published an interactive mental health toolkit website from scratch 
              using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I implemented features to enhance user experience, including links to resources (apps, lifelines, 
              and supplemental sources). To create this website, I collaborated with a team of mentors/peers to execute the project, ensure user 
              friendliness, and enable full accessibility.

            <p class="project-name">Cracking Ceasar's Cipher (Cryptography Tool)</p>
            <p class="project-desription">I created a Python tool that decrypts Caesar cipher messages by testing all possible key shifts, helping 
              users uncover hidden text. I set up functions to handle character shifts (including special cases) using a range of letters, numbers, 
              and symbols. When users input an encrypted message, they get back every possible decoded version, making it easy to find the correct key.
